         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>ING <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of ever bleſſed Memory, in the Tenth Year of His Reign, was ſeized of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>High Peak</hi> in the County of <hi>Darby,</hi> then and before, plentifully ſtored with Red Deer, that there were Forreſters there, and the Forreſt Laws continually put in execution; That the Freeholders and Tenants of the ſeveral Towns within the ſaid Forreſt; <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Bowden, Middle-cale, Chappel</hi> in <hi>le Frith, Shalcroſs, Fairfeild, Fernaly, Caſtleton, Mellor, Hope, Bradwell,</hi> and <hi>Wormhill,</hi> finding themſelves much aggreived, not only with the Deer by eating up their Corn and Graſs, but alſo with the Severity of the Laws of the ſaid Forreſt, did Petition His ſaid Majeſty to deſtroy the ſaid Forreſt, and improve his Waſts and Commons there, which were very large, whereupon the King was moſt Graciouſly pleaſed to condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the deſtruction of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and one <hi>Thomas Herroyd</hi> whoſe Charges were likewiſe born by that Town, and all the ſeveral Agents for the reſpective Towns within the ſaid Forreſt for which they were entruſted, did Conſent and Agree, that His then Majeſty ſhould have a Moyety of their Waſts, at which time the Agents for <hi>Bowden, Middle-cale,</hi> did Contract and Agree for the Kings Moyety within them for a Fine and Yearly Rent, all the ſaid Commons were Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, and moſt of them divided into Two equal parts, one for His then Majeſty, and the other for the Tenants; before the ſaid Agents were ſent to treat with the then Chancellor for the purpoſe aforeſaid, and the Agents for the Towns within the ſaid Forreſt having all Agreed and Conſented that the King ſhould have one Moyety of the Commons, and <hi>Bowden Middle-cale</hi> having Contracted for the Kings Moyety within them, His then Majeſty being on His part to deſtroy the ſaid Forreſt, accordingly did deſtroy the ſame, and any Perſon after the firſt Days Hunting had liberty to kill Deer there, and the Forreſters from the remote parts of the ſaid For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt did fetch in the Deer into the Campain or the plain part of the Forreſt that they might the more eaſily there be killed and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed, and His Majeſty having performed what on His part was to be done, and preſently after that the late horrid Rebellion broke out which put a ſtop to His then Majeſties Improving or Farming His Moyety of the ſaid Commons, and the now Appealants ever ſince that time do enjoy all the Profits of the ſaid Commons, as well the Kings as their own part, ſo that His ſaid late Majeſty never received any Profit or Compenſation for the deſtruction of His Forreſt, all which proceedings as aforeſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſacted at the then Chancellors Houſe, moſt of the Records relating to that matter, are either loſt or miſlaid.</p>
            <p>And to prevent all juſt Accuſations of a project or ſurprize of the Country, the Relator <hi>Eyre</hi> did not make his diſcovery until His late Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second of ever bleſſed Memory had happily been reſtored Fourteen Years, and then obtained Grants from the Queen Dowager, of the ſaid Moyety belonging to the Crown, being part of Her ſaid Majeſties Joincture under a Yearly Rent, with a clauſe of Determination in the Grant for non-payment of the Rent, and likewiſe obtained a Grant of the reverſion from His ſaid late Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and then the Relator <hi>Eyre,</hi> entred upon the ſame, and the Freeholders in all as well as in theſe Towns of <hi>Bradwell, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Wormhill,</hi> did deny the Kings Right, the King having long ago made very great improvements ſo that they have not ſufficient Common for their Cattle and claimed all to be their own but the Soyle, Whereupon Mr. Attorny General of the Dutchy by the Relation of <hi>Thomas Eyre</hi> the ſaid Patente, in the Year 1674 exhibited an Information, againſt the Inhabitants of <hi>Bowden, Middle-cale,</hi> and after a long Suit upon very good proof of all the matter before recited did obtain a Decree for the Kings Moyety whithin that Town, <note place="margin">In <hi>June</hi> 79.</note> and on re-hearing the ſame Cauſe the Decree was confirmed, after which the King and now Queen Dowager by their Attornies the now Lord Privy Seal, the Earl of <hi>Cheſterfeild,</hi> the Lord Chief Baron <hi>Mountague,</hi> the King and Queens ſurviving Truſtees, the Relator <hi>Eyre,</hi> and <hi>George Shaw,</hi> exhibited another Information againſt all the Freeholders in the Towns of <hi>Caſtleton, Mellor, Chappel</hi> in <hi>le Frith, Shalcroſs, Fairfeild, Fernaly, Hope, Bradwell,</hi> and <hi>Wormhill,</hi> which Information was to the ſame effect as the former, and after another long and tedious Suit, upon the very ſame proofs as in the former Suit obtained a Decree, <note place="margin">In <hi>Feb.</hi> 82.</note> which upon a re-hearing was likewiſe confirmed, and the now Appealants <hi>William Ing, Thomas Eyre, Henry Balgay,</hi> &amp;c. were all ſerved with Privy Seals out of the Dutchy Court but did not appear, but ſtood in contempt till after the Decree upon the ſaid laſt mentioned Information wherein they were named parties, knowing the Kings evidence, whereby they might prepare croſe Interrogatories thereby to puſſel the Kings aged Witneſſes, and likewiſe counter prove their Teſtimonies by the help of leading Interrogatories, then came and prayed that they might be heard. Whereupon a Third Information was exhibited againſt them, <note place="margin">In <hi>June</hi> 84.</note> and after ſeveral hearings obtained a Decree for the Kings Moyety within the Towns of <hi>Hope, Bradwel,</hi> and <hi>Wormhill,</hi> which Decree laſt mentioned upon re-hearing was confirmed; Thſee Three Towns which now Complain are the beſt Land, and did lie in moſt of the ſpoyle of the Deer, would have all thoſe Towns as <hi>Bowden, Middle-cale, Mellor, Shalcroſs,</hi> which are very Barren and Boggy Land to be bound by the Agreement, and theirs being the beſt Land to be unconcerned, and would after Forty ſix Years, the Deer being deſtroyed as aforeſaid in execution of the ſaid Agreement on the Kings part, and the King having performed His part of the ſaid Agreement, and ſo improof they endeavour to compel His Majeſty to try this Agreement at Law made Forty ſix Years ſince, and by ſuch Tryal upon an improvement deſign to overthrow the ſaid Decree ſo ſolemnly made in a matter properly examinable and determinable in Equity, in the ſaid Court of Dutchy, being the Kings Court of Revenue as well as a Court of Equity, having proper Juriſdiction of the ſaid Cauſe, and having ſo deliberately heard and determined the ſame. And by the King and Queens Prerogative they may try their Cauſe in what Court they pleaſe, and not be preſcribed to their Court or the manner of their proceeding by the defendant to their Suit.</p>
            <p>Theſe Appellants do alleage that they have differenced their Caſe from the other Caſe, and the reaſon not the ſame, or an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, there having been ſome Hundred years ago, many great improvements made within them, <hi>(viz.)</hi> within <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Bradwel,</hi> hath been improved a great parcel of Ground called the <hi>Woodlands</hi> or <hi>Croekhill,</hi> another piece called <hi>Edal.</hi> And within <hi>Wormhill</hi> hath been improved a piece of Land called the <hi>Campaign,</hi> the over end, and <hi>Green Fairfeild,</hi> and ſo by thoſe improvements they have not Common leſt ſufficient for their Commonable Cattle, and ſo would inſinuate that the now improvement ought to be upon no other ground or reaſon but upon ſurplus of Common.</p>
            <p>All the Defendants in the Information againſt the Freeholders of <hi>Bowden, Middle-cale,</hi> where the Commons are very Barren, did by their Anſwers ſay, That the Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> and Dukes of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> had made ſo great Improvements within them that they had not ſufficient Common leſt, and no reaſon for another Improvement now, and did ſet forth, that divers great parcels of Land to a conſiderable Yearly value were improved <hi>(viz.) Chenly</hi> or <hi>Maidſtone Feild, Shellfe, Comes</hi> and <hi>Twarden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all the Defendants to the Information againſt <hi>Chappel</hi> in <hi>le Frith, Mellar, Shalcroſs, Fairfield, Fernaly, Caſtleton, Hope, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, Wormhill,</hi> did by their Anſwers uſe the ſame Argument for themſelves, and ſaid that the <hi>Campaign,</hi> and all the <hi>Woodlands,</hi> the over end, and <hi>Green Fairfield</hi> were taken from them, and ſo no Surplus of Common nor ſufficient leſt for their Cattle.</p>
            <p>The Defendants to all the ſaid Informations have uſed the ſame Argument as aforeſaid, and ſo overlook the conſideration of the Kings deſtroying His Forreſt, as not valuable to them, and their incloſed Lands freed from the Forreſt Laws, as not conſiderable.</p>
            <p>All the ſaid Improved Lands were ſeveralties in many parts of the Forreſt for to fat the Kings Deer, and no Man claimed or had any Common there, but Cattle were ageſted there to feed amongſt the Deer, as the Forresſers ſaw occaſion.</p>
